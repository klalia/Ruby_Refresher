# Ruby_Refresher

This was a ruby refresher labs that tested array and hashes. It was to refresh my memory on how we can test arrays and how to access specific elements in those arrays or hashes. 

#### Array Lab

This lab included testing arrays, two-dimensional arrays and multidimensional arrays. To test an array square brackets are used ([]) with the index of the array in the square brackets. Arrays start from index value 0.

#### Hash Lab

This lab included testing hashes and testing the keys and values within that hash. To test a hash value you use square brackets then a semi colon before the key or value name. To access elements in a hash you need to put the specific key and value pairs down. Loops were also created to make tests more dynamic, this was done using an each loop for the key and values. An example was ensuring that the values were 4 for each key.
